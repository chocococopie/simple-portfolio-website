Layout refers to how content is arranged on the page. In this project, you'll focus on:

Creating a consistent structure (e.g., header at top, footer at bottom, main content in between)
Using layout components like <Container>, <Grid>, or <Flex> to organize elements
Ensuring responsive design so it looks good on desktop and mobile



Components composition means building complex UIs by combining smaller, reusable components.

In your portfolio project, this could look like:

A Header component used across all pages
A ProjectCard component that you use multiple times in the Projects section
A Layout component that wraps each page with the same header/footer
Nesting components inside each other (e.g., <Layout><AboutPage /></Layout>)
It’s like assembling Lego blocks to build a full structure—clean, modular, and easy to update.
